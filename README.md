## Problems

### Friday

- We had trouble building the initial project files due to an issue with Windows OneDrive. After realizing that the application was not the issue, we moved the project outside of the OneDrive folder. After this we were able to build our project with no issues.

### Saturday

- We had issues integrating the react-native-chessboard API with the Expo Framework because of limited documentation and versatility compared to a react-chessboard API. To not lose valuable time, we decided to pivot from a mobile application to a web application.
- We were initially going to use GPT-4 but decided to downgrade to GTP3.5 Turbo due to a more economic pricing.
